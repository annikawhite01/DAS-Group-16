The length of time an animal stays in a shelter is a complex issue, influenced by a few factors. This study utilizes data from the Dallas Animal Shelter to investigate the determinants affecting the length of stay for animals before the resolution of their shelter outcome. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), including both Poisson and negative binomial distributions, we aim to identify key factors which contribute to the time animals spend in the shelter.
